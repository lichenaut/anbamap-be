# Anbamap Scraper

This repository contains the database utility software for Anbamap.

&nbsp;

## Overview

Anbamap Scraper scrapes text from [configured media sources](#environment-variables), uses two layers of region identification to determine which regions a piece of media is related to, and stores this information. [By default](#environment-variables), it will also clear out any data aged older than one week.

#### Identification Layers

The two layers of identification are as follows:

1. [flashgeotext](https://github.com/iwpnd/flashgeotext): a Python library that determines related regions from text with OK accuracy. This is mainly for handling capital letter-dependent meanings.
2. Keyphrase checking: an in-memory data structure of keyphrases that are checked against scraped text content. Please help me maintain [the keyphrases](https://github.com/lichenaut/anbamap-scraper/blob/main/src/scrape/region.rs) as time goes on! In addition to manual input, it is informed from the following: [Geonames](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/), [Forbes400](https://forbes400.onrender.com/api/forbes400/getAllBillionaires), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&rvslots=main&format=json&titles=List_of_largest_private_non-governmental_companies_by_revenue).

#### Database Structure

The database will be located in a Docker volume as 'media_db.sqlite'. See [Deployment](#deployment).

##### Rust Code

```rust
pool.execute(
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS urls (
        url TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        timestamp INTEGER,
        title TEXT,
        body TEXT
    )",
)
.await?;
pool.execute(
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS url_regions (
        url TEXT,
        region_code TEXT,
        PRIMARY KEY (url, region_code),
        FOREIGN KEY (url) REFERENCES urls (url)
    )",
)
.await?;
```

##### Column Descriptions

| Column      | Description                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp` | UNIX seconds time of scrape.          |
| `title`     | Primary text of scraped media.        |
| `body`      | Secondary text of scraped media.      |
| `regions`   | Comma-separated related region codes. |

&nbsp;

## Deployment

1. Create a Docker volume, pull the Docker image, and run a container.

```bash
docker volume create anbamap_vol
docker pull lichenaut/anbamap-scraper:latest
docker run -v anbamap_vol:/scraper/data -e DOCKER_VOLUME=/scraper/data image-id
```

The first run will take a few minutes to set up files.

2. Automate this run command at an interval of your choice.
